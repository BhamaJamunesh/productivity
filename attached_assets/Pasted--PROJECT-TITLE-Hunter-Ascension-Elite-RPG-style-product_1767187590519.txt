🎮 PROJECT TITLE

Hunter Ascension
Elite RPG-style productivity system inspired by hunter anime aesthetics and system-driven progression.

🧠 ROLE

You are a senior frontend engineer and UI designer building a React + Vite web app.
Focus on immersive UI, smooth animations, and clean state logic.
No backend. Use localStorage for persistence.

🧱 TECH STACK

React (functional components)

Vite

CSS Modules or Tailwind

Framer Motion for animations

Lucide or custom SVG icons

LocalStorage for data

Dark-mode-first design

🎨 VISUAL STYLE

Semi-dark fantasy UI

Neon accents: cyan, blue, violet

Glassmorphism panels

HUD-style borders and overlays

Soft glow, no clutter

Subtle particle effects on rank-up only

Avoid childish UI.
This must feel elite, restrained, and powerful.
